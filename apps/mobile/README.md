# My Goal app
Delivers a mobile app track the workout plans, gains, time the workouts and follow other users progress (coming soon). 

# Technologies
To start the project Expo was the tool of choice. Nowadays I particularlly don't see a point to start a RN project without it. It speed up the startup of new projects and has a lot of tooling out of the box ready to be used. If you need to eject. Even more now with `Development builds` that brings the easy side of `managed workflow` with the flexibility of a `bare workflow` together

To build and deploy the application I'm using  EAS build and submit, it speeds up a lot the pipeline.

## List of technologies

## Process

The most challenging part of this project was to understand the user feedback, filter and apply to the application. The goal here is to ease the user XP and make it easier during the training sessions.
